                <h2>Learn the songs</h2>            
                <p>
                    Your musicians want to learn the songs, but the reality is that many church musicians have full-time jobs and families.  It can be hard to find the time to learn songs excellently. Now you can give them exactly what they need so they never have to spend hours trying to learn those parts again!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only are our lessons and tools easy to follow for beginner musicians, but now seasoned musicians have a place to go to learn those hard to pick out parts exactly like the album.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you can find the exact song you are looking for and send the parts out to your team in an instant.  You'd never have to worry if the parts are accurate. Your players will show up knowing their stuff and be able to focus on what matters the most – Worship.

                <p>
                    Low quality video can make it impossible for team members to learn the songs well. Overcompressed audio and fuzzy footage are the last thing your players need when they are trying to learn intricate parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worship Online offers high quality, professionally recorded video and audio production on all of our video lessons so your musicians can nail the parts as they were intended.

                <h2>Eliminate all guesswork</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’re like us, you’ve searched YouTube for hours trying to find tutorials. Then you’ve either come up empty handed, or found some low quality hybrid stuff. And the last thing we want, or want our team doing, is IMPROVISING!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the most talented musicians in the world spent some serious time creating the instrument parts to the worship music we love. So why not learn the parts as they created them? Or at least start from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our access to the artist’s original multitracks, we can teach you ALL of the parts, exactly like the artist plays them. From parts that are hard to pick out, to soaring leads. We make learning your favorite worship songs simple and fun!
